			<p class="box4">Originally called Naniwa, the Osaka  prefecture has been occupied for over 10,000 years.It housed the first capital of Japan, Naniwa city (presently Osaka city), sometime during the 4th or 5th century.Though it was considered the capital of Japan, it was  not officially called the capital until the 7th century.Since then, it has been the capital another  two times. Osaka city's primary use has been a major port city, and still is. With its close proximity to water and its rich history, it has flourished to one of the largest cities in Japan over the centuries 
Osaka city was the first capital of Japan because it was the most  popular port city of the time; bring new ideas, cultures and politics into the  Japanese world. Being a port city, it  has been considered the merchants capital, where the merchants have the most  political power. This was most apparent  during the 15th century where Sakai,  present day Osaka,  was considered a free city. It was not  under the rule of any particular government and was run only by merchants who  banded together to form a guild called za.This was amazing considering the fact that  during the mid 15th to 16th century, Japan was in a  civil strife with no leading figure. Almost every other region was fighting to control another region with  the exception of Osaka  being almost free from major conflicts. During this time, the name Osaka  started to take prevalence over Naniwa, and the way the name was written was  changed again during the beginning of the Meji era.
During the 16th century, Toyotomi Hideyoshi unified the whole  of Japan, being at peace for  over 100 years, and made Osaka the political and  economic capital of Japan,  though the actual capital at the time was Kyoto.
Beginning in the 17th century, the Edo period saw a rise in Osakas population and its  importance as a port once again.Throughout  the next few centuries, Osaka city grew from  simply a merchant town to the third largest city in Japan,  and the Osaka prefecture itself grew to the  second largest prefecture in the whole of Japan.</p>
